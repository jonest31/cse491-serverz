Find the happiness in all of life's crappiness.
Know your limits and then defy them.
What defines us is how well we rise after falling.
Always believe that something wonderful is about to happen.
The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.
Be yourself, everyone else is taken.
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.
Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.
